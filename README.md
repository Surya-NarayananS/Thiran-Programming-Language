# Thiran-Programming-Language
# திறன் நிரலாக்க மொழி
Thiran (திறன்) is a simple, easy-to-learn programming language that allows coding in Tamil. The programming language will help tamil-medium school students to develop their problem-solving skills by making code more readable and understandable. It will familiarize them with the concepts and fundamentals of programming before moving on to real-world programming languages. Furthermore, this project will contribute to the growth of the technology industry in Tamil-speaking regions, leading to more diverse and inclusive programming solutions.

#### Note: This is part of our college's final project and is currently in development

(As of 26th march, 2023)
## Active Todo:
- built-in functions (eg: type())
- List Datatype
- Ability to import libraries
- Useful libraries like math, etc
- error names in tamil
- multi-line comment ability
- write multiple demo programs
- ability to run a program file with our compiler
- explainer comments

## Issues Found:
1. [Resolved - 26th march 2023] 
    Outside a loop, when 'break' is used inside 'if' & 'if' evaluates to false
    no error is thrown.
2. [Resolved - 26th march 2023]
    Outside a fn, 'return' works inside loops, conditionals.

## Future Todo:
- Exception Handling
- Nested Function Call (Need to check)

## Entire Tasks List
1. Numbers (int, float)
2. string
3. unary number (+/-)
4. Errors
5. arithmetic operators
6. binary operation evaluation
7. execute a program file with multiple lines of code
8. operator precedence
9. comparison operators
10. logical operators
11. assignment operators
12. variables
13. I/O statments
14. conditionals (if, elif, else)
15. Loops (for, while)
16. Functions
17. Jump statements (return, break, continue)
