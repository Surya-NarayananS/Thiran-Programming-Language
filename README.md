# Thiran-Programming-Language
# திறன் நிரலாக்க மொழி
Thiran (திறன்) is a simple, easy-to-learn programming language that allows coding in Tamil. The programming language will help tamil-medium school students to develop their problem-solving skills by making code more readable and understandable. It will familiarize them with the concepts and fundamentals of programming before moving on to real-world programming languages. Furthermore, this project will contribute to the growth of the technology industry in Tamil-speaking regions, leading to more diverse and inclusive programming solutions.

#### Note: This is part of our college's final project and is currently in development

(As of 12th april, 2023)
## Active Todo:
- explainer comments

## Issues Found:
1. [Resolved - 26th march 2023] 
    Outside a loop, when 'break' is used inside 'if' & 'if' evaluates to false
    no error is thrown.
2. [Resolved - 26th march 2023]
    Outside a fn, 'return' works inside loops, conditionals.
3. [Resolved - 8th april 2023]
    'break' doesn't work as expected inside nested loops.

## Future Todo:
- Exception Handling
- Ability to call functions inside conditionals or inside another function call
- Multi-level indexing
- Multi-line comments
- Bitwise Operators
- standalone math library
- random library
- datetime library
- OS file handling support
- GUI library
- Extend Error class to give more details

## Entire Tasks List:
1. Numbers (int, float)
2. string
3. unary number (+/-)
4. Errors
5. arithmetic operators
6. binary operation evaluation
7. execute a program file with multiple lines of code
8. single line comments
9. operator precedence
10. comparison operators
11. logical operators
12. assignment operators
13. variables
14. I/O statments
15. conditionals (if, elif, else)
16. Loops (for, while)
17. Functions
18. Jump statements (return, break, continue)
19. Basic built-in functions (eg: type_of(), round_func(), power(), etc)
20. List Datatype
21. Built-in functions for list manipulation:
    - append_list()
    - remove_from_list()
    - add_to_list()
    - pop_list()
    - list_len()
22. Importing libraries
23. Useful built-in functions for math, random, etc
24. write multiple demo programs
